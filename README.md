# APFSOptimize

Makes APFS clones from duplicate files to save space. No guarantees that this does not break anything or causes data loss, so use at your own risk.

To use: Run with the target folder as argument, or with no arguments to deduplicate the current working directory.

Currently does not handle permissions and attributes correctly
